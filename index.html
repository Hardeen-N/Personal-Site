          <h3>Design</h3>
          <p class="designskill-txt">I have always enjoyed designing, creating new things and problem solving. I have a design degree in Interior Architecture and have been working as a junior designer for two years.
            I also have a background in graphic design and have always been interested in how this intergrates into web and app design. I have recently started learning to code and I love it! This is a passion and skill I want to take further to eventually become a fully fledged Developer!</p>

<!--The margin property may be specified using one, two, three, or four values. Each value is a <length>, a <percentage>, or the keyword auto.
Negative values draw the element closer to its neighbors than it would be by default.
When one value is specified, it applies the same margin to all four sides.
When two values are specified, the first margin applies to the top and bottom, the second to the left and right.
When three values are specified, the first margin applies to the top, the second to the right and left, the third to the bottom.
When four values are specified, the margins apply to the top, right, bottom, and left in that order (clockwise).-->
